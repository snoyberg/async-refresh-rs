# async-refresh

**FIXME** Include badges.

Create values that refresh automatically after a given duration. Refreshing happens asynchronously in a separate task. Values are available via an `Arc`. The refresh task will automatically exit when the value is no longer referenced by any other part of the program.

**FIXME** Include an example.
